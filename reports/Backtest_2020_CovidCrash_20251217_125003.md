## Conclusion

✅ **The strategy successfully protected capital during the 2022 bear market.**

By using the macro filter (200-day SMA) and sniper shorts, the strategy avoided 
extended exposure during the downturn. This demonstrates the value of:
1. Staying out of the market when macro conditions are bearish
2. Using ATR-based stop-losses to limit drawdowns
3. Sniper shorting opportunities during confirmed downtrends
